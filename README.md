Scraping and analyzing rulings of the Swiss Federal Administrative Court

The code downloads court cases from the website of the Swiss Federal Administrative Court (scrapingcases.py), and extracts 
information from them, such as nationality and gender of the claimant (data_extraction.ipynb).

In a next step, the data will be analyzed in more detail to detect patterns.

This project is part of the nccr - on the move (www.nccr-onthemove.ch), funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.
